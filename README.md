Original Instructions:

# Houses of Westeros

When you play the Game of Rails, you win or you die.

You'll be making a Ruby on Rails app connecting Game of Thrones characters to their respective houses. Implement **full CRUD functionality** on the models.

We will start off with two models: `Houses` and `Characters`. Houses have many characters. Characters belong to a single house.

The styling of the app is completely up to you. With that said, a cool GoT themed font has been included in this repository for you to integrate if you choose. To add it, in your `application.css` file, add the following:

```css
/* assets/stylesheets */
@font-face {
  font-family: "thrones";
  src: url('game_of_thrones.ttf') format("truetype");
}

/* assets/fonts */
@font-face {
  font-family: "thrones";
  src: font-url('game_of_thrones.ttf') format("truetype");
}
```

## Models and Migrations

- Create an ERD for your `houses` and `characters` tables
- Create corresponding models and migrations
- Create seed data that generates some houses and characters

> Use [this wiki](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_Wiki) or this [diagram](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-w7EWwY4aLaw/UEjPybySOmI/AAAAAAAADRA/F7kZGZGNfPg/s1600/games-of-thrones_a-visual-guide-to-the-faces-of-season-1.jpg) if you need some source material for your seed file. Or just make up some names!

## Views and Controllers

- Add controllers and views for to allow for full **CRUD** functionality for both of your models.
- Add styling to your app by adding / modifying stylesheets in `app/assets/stylesheets`

## Bonus: User Authentication

Once -- **and only after** -- you have completed all of the above and implemented full CRUD functionality for Houses and Characters, add a third User model using Devise.

- You should be able to sign up, sign in and sign out of the app
- Only logged-in users should be able to create a House or Character
- A user can only update or delete a House or Character he/she created

> Think about what associations you will have to set up in order to implement these features

## Some More Bonuses

- Add a third model for quotes associated with a character.
- Try out many-to-many relationships with Categories to label Characters. A Character can have many Categories (e.g., "merciless") and a Category can be associated with many Characters. A Tag model/table could be helpful here...
- Create an admin role (i.e., somebody who can update/delete anything) using [CanCanCan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan).
- Add a ***COMBAT MODE*** using custom routes and controllers (models are not necessary for this feature, but certainly could be used to implement it)
